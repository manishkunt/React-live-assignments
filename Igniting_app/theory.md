Question: What is NPM ?
Answer: NPM manages packages but does not stand for Node Package Manager.
        It is a repository for packages.
        It is a tool for managing JavaScript packages. It helps install,
        update, and manage libraries or dependencies for projects.


Question: What is Parcel/Webpack ? Why do we need it ?
Answer:  Parcel and Webpack are JavaScript bundlers that help optimize and
         manage assets in web development.

         Why do we need them ?
         1. Bundle files
         2. Minification
         3. Module support
         4. Hot Reloading
         5. Code Splitting
         6. Dev build
         7. Local Server
         8. HMR(Hot Module Replacement), etc


Question: What is .parcel-cache ?
Answer:   The .parcel-cache folder is created by parcel to store cached information 
          about your project. It speeds up the build process by reusing previously 
          processed files, rather than reprocessing everything from scratch every time
          you build or serve the project.


Question: What is npx ?
Answer: npx => executing a package. npx is commonly used to run react-related tools
        without needing to install them globally.


Question:  What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
Answer: dependencies: package required for your project to run in production.
        ex. React, Express
        devDependencies: packages only needed during development.
        ex. testing frameworks, build tools like Webpack or parcel


Question:  What is Tree Shaking? 
Answer:    Tree Shaking is a technique used to remove any unused code from your JavaScript
           Bundle. It helps optimize the final output by eliminating dead code, improving 
           performance and reducing file size. Commonly used with bundlers  like Webpack.


Question:  What is Hot Module Replacement? 
Answer:    Hot Module Replacement(HMR) is a feature in bundlers like Webpack that allows updating modules
           in real time without refreshing the entire page. It keeps the app intact, making development
           faster and smoother.


Question:  List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your 
           own words. 
Answer:    Caching => faster build, it keeps cache in .parcel-cache file. So it will take less time
           rebuilding next time.
           Differenntial bundling => to support older browser versions. It is done with the help of
           browserslist which has to placed in the package-json file.
           Error handling => Parcels also do error handling and show beautiful errors on the console
           and the web page and also gives hint on where the possible problem lies.


Question:  What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it? 
Answer:    Files that can be regerenated should not be pushed to github as it would only bulk the size
           of the code on github server. They can simply be regenrated if we have the desired files.
           ex. node_modules, dist, .parcel-cache 
           The files which we need are  package.json and package-lock.json so that whatever is on local
           could be on the server as well.


Question:  What is the difference between `package.json` and package-lock.json ?
Answer:    package.json: Lists the project dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It specifies the packages
           your project needs, but not the exact versions.
           package-lock.json: Records the exact versions of all installed packages and their dependencies.
           It ensures consistent installs across environments.


Question:  Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`? 
Answer:    You should not modify package-lock.json manually beacause it is automatically generated by the 
           npm and managed by npm. Manaual changes can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behaviour 
           in package versions. Let npm handle updates and management to ensure proper dependency
           resolution.


Question:  What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
Answer:    node_modules is a directory where npm installs your project's dependencies.
           It is not a good idea to push it to Git beacause - 
           1.Size: It can be very large, increasing the repository size.
           2.Redundancy: Dependencies are listed in package.json and can be installed using 'npm install'.
           3.Cross-platform issues: Packages might not be compatible across different systems.


Question:  What is the `dist` folder?
Answer:    Short for "distribution" folder contains the final, optimized, and bundled version of your
           code,ready for deployment. It usually includes minified JavaScript, CSS, and other assets.


Question:  What is `browserlists`
Answer:    It is a tool used to specify which browsers your project should support.

Question:   dif bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel
Answer:     Vite
            Speed: Very fast due to its use of native ES modules. It serves files directly in development
            without bundling, which makes hot module replacement (HMR) extremely quick.
            Build: Uses Rollup under the hood for optimized production builds.
            Configuration: Minimal setup required. Configurations are mostly done via a simple
            vite.config.js file.
            Features: Provides built-in support for modern JavaScript features, CSS, and static assets.
            Also supports plugins for additional functionalities.

            Webpack
            Flexibility: Highly customizable with a vast ecosystem of plugins and loaders. Ideal for complex
            projects needing fine-grained control over the build process.
            Build: Bundles and optimizes all assets, including JavaScript, CSS, images, etc. Requires
            configuration through a webpack.config.js file.
            Configuration: Can be complex and verbose, but offers deep control over every aspect of the build
            process.
            Features: Supports code splitting, tree shaking, and various module formats. Well-suited for large
            applications and complex setups.

            Parcel
            Ease of Use: Zero-config out of the box. Automatically handles many aspects of bundling without
            needing extensive configuration.
            Build: Bundles and optimizes assets similarly to Webpack but with less setup. Uses its own internal
            mechanisms for efficient builds.
            Configuration: Minimal configuration required, typically through a parcel-config.js file if needed.
            Features: Includes features like hot module replacement (HMR), support for various asset types, and
            built-in optimizations. Best for projects that need a quick setup with fewer customization requirements.


Question:    ^ - caret and ~ - tilda ?
Answer:      In package.json, ^ and ~ are used to specify version ranges for dependencies:

             ^ (Caret): Allows updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit. For example, ^1.2.3 allows
             updates to 1.x.x but not 2.x.x.

             ~ (Tilde): Allows updates that do not change the middle digit. For example, ~1.2.3 allows updates to
             1.2.x but not 1.3.0.

             These symbols help manage dependency versions and ensure compatibility while allowing for minor updates
             and patches.


Question:    Script types in html (MDN Docs) ?
Answer:      1. text/javascript
             Usage: The default type for JavaScript code. If omitted, browsers assume this type.
             Behavior: The script is executed as standard JavaScript.
             ex. <script type="text/javascript">
                 console.log('Hello, World!');
                 </script>

              2. module
              Usage: Specifies that the script is a JavaScript module. Modules use ES6 syntax, including import and 
              export statements.
              Behavior: The script is treated as a module, which means it supports imports and exports, and is loaded 
              asynchronously. 
              ex.   <script type="module">
                    import { sayHello } from './hello.js';
                         sayHello();
                     </script>

               3. text/babel: Used for Babel-transpiled scripts, often seen in development setups with Babel.

               4. application/json: Used for embedding JSON data in scripts.

               5. text/typescript: Used for TypeScript code, though browsers do not natively support TypeScript; 
               it's typically processed by build tools.
